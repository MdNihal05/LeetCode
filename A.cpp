**Project Overview:**
Build a **quick commerce mobile app** for construction material shopping using **React Native** and **Expo**. The backend API, routes, controllers, and models will be utilized to implement a fully functional, user-friendly UI for browsing, ordering, and managing construction materials. Focus on a modern and sleek design inspired by Stripe and Zomato.

**Technology Stack:**
- **Frontend:** React Native, Expo (JavaScript)
- **State Management:** Redux (for persistence)

### **Step-by-Step Procedure to Ensure Success:**

1. **Read the Backend Models and API Routes:**
- Understand the backend structure by reviewing **models, routes, controllers**, and **index files**.
- Ensure that each UI feature corresponds to a backend API.

2. **Design UI Components:**
- Create reusable UI components such as buttons, headers, cards, input fields, and modals.
- Focus on **Stripe** and **Zomato**-inspired modern and minimalistic styles.

3. **Setup State Management (Redux):**
- Implement **Redux** for global state management.
- Set up actions and reducers to handle authentication, cart, order history, and product details.

4. **Build Navigation:**
- Set up navigation using **React Navigation** for seamless transitions between screens.
- Implement stack and tab navigation for various sections (Home, Cart, Orders, Profile, etc.).

5. **Connect Backend APIs to UI:**
- Fetch data from the backend API and display it on the appropriate screens.
- Ensure each screen (Home, Product Details, Cart, Checkout, etc.) is functional with live data from APIs.

6. **Order Management and Cart:**
- Implement functionality for adding/removing items from the cart.
- Track the user's order status and integrate real-time tracking.

7. **Checkout and Payment:**
- Implement a **payment gateway** (or a mock for demo purposes).
- Allow users to select an address, add/edit details, and place orders.
8.after completing project check if all features mentioned here are completed or not like screens,features etc
9. **Refactor and Optimize Code:**
- Ensure the code is modular, clean, and free from errors.
- Test the app under different conditions to ensure smooth performance.

10. **Final Review and Adjustments:**
- Check if all the **15 key features** are implemented.
- Ensure **UI consistency** and **responsive design** across all screens.
- Validate that the **backend API integration** is complete and working as expected.
